<h3>About:</h3>

Python and Statistics for Financial Analysis is a course offered by The Honk Kong University of Sciences and Technologies through the coursera platform.

The goal of the course is to teach how to use Python for:

    - Import, pre-process, save and visualize financial data into pandas Dataframe;
    - Manipulate the existing financial data by generating new variables using multiple columns;
    - Recall and apply the important statistical concepts into financial contexts;
    - Build a trading model using multiple linear regression model;
    - Evaluate the performance of the trading model using different investment indicators.
    
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks with the assignments, exercises, and codes written during the specialization.
